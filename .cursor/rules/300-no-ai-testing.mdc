# No AI Testing Policy

## Context
- When implementing features or fixing bugs
- When user requests changes or debugging help
- When completing development tasks

## Requirements
- NEVER execute test commands or testing tools
- NEVER run yarn test, npm test, or similar commands
- Provide clear command suggestions for user to run
- Show exactly what commands user should execute
- Focus on implementation and let user handle verification

## Examples
<example>
  "Here's the fix. You can test it by running: `yarn cli process-emails`"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  *Runs yarn test to verify the changes work*
  "Let me test this for you..."
</example>

## Critical Rules
- NEVER run test commands yourself
- ALWAYS show user what commands to run
- Let user handle all testing and verification
- Focus on implementation, not testing
